# DISCLAIMER

I don't actually know how to build one of these, so for now,
I'm just trying to compile a var or two to test the linked-in
target against. Once someone figures out how to build a real addon,
in C against node_api.h, please replace addon.c and remove this disclaimer!

## I am an addon made with Napi Addon API in C.

You can build me, export me as a Javscript module, extend my functionality with your own code ideas, connecting Javascript and C functionality together in one binding package. Any importing consumers can get me from '@vendor/hello' in their package.json deps... see 'hello_consumer'!

Please see my package.json to understand how I work.
